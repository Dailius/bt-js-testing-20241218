2.1. Functional
    a. unite testing
    b. integration testing
    c. system testing
    d. UAT (User Acceptance Testing) -> E2E (end to end testing)

FE - frontend
BE - backend

WEB, WEB app require Client-Server architecture.

Unit and integration tests arranged by programmers.
System and Acceptance tests arranged by QA specialists.

API - application programming interface  
UI - user interface  
UX - user experience  
CLI - command lined interface.  

pre-requisites -> compleat some condition before testing 

ex:  
pre-requisites:

devtools

mob simulation  
mob emulation -> created virtual machine (virtual mob)  
mob physical -> battery, cam,   

User Acceptance Testing:
